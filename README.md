# NLServer

NetherLink backend foundation, built from `backend-requirements.md`.

Current scope is intentionally small:

- Go module bootstrap under `cmd/` and `internal/`.
- Environment-based config loading under `internal/config`.
- Thin HTTP server under `internal/server`.
- PostgreSQL connection pool setup under `internal/database`.
- Redis client setup under `internal/cache`.
- PostgreSQL repositories for users, user preferences, user sessions, friends, and groups under `internal/repository`.
- P0 auth service under `internal/auth`: password hashing, access token signing/validation, refresh token hashing/rotation, PostgreSQL-backed session checks, current-user profile updates, public ID checks/changes, and device session management.
- Object storage interface skeleton under `internal/storage`.
- PostgreSQL schema bootstrap under `db/`.
- Redis service bootstrap under `docker-compose.yml`.
- MinIO object storage bootstrap under `minio/`.
- Health endpoints, API v1 root, request IDs, panic recovery, structured access logs, JSON 404/405 responses, request body helper functions, readiness checks for PostgreSQL and Redis, and Bearer access-token validation are available.
- P0 auth HTTP handlers are available: register, login, refresh, logout, session listing/revoke, `/me`, profile editing, public ID availability/change, `GET /me/preferences`, and `PATCH /me/preferences`.
- User/friend/group read HTTP handlers are available: user search/detail/batch, friend list/group list, group list/detail/member list.
- No MinIO SDK implementation, file processing workers, friend/group write handlers, chat/post/AI API handlers, or WebSocket realtime events yet.
- Redis is used only for auth rate limiting today. It is not used as the source of truth for users, refresh token sessions, messages, notifications, file metadata, or durable business state.

## Start Local Dependencies

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Fill NETHERLINK_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET, NETHERLINK_POSTGRES_PASSWORD,
# NETHERLINK_OBJECT_STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY, and NETHERLINK_OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY.
docker compose up -d postgres redis minio minio-init
docker compose ps
```

## Run The API Server

```sh
set -a
. ./.env
set +a
go run ./cmd/nlserver
```

Default server address:

- HTTP: http://localhost:8080
- Liveness: `GET /healthz`
- Readiness: `GET /readyz`
- API root: `GET /api/v1`

`/healthz` only verifies that the process is serving HTTP. `/readyz` pings PostgreSQL and Redis, and returns `503 SERVICE_NOT_READY` until both dependencies are reachable.
Unknown routes and unsupported methods return the standard JSON error shape with `code`, `message`, and `requestId`.

Auth configuration:

- `NETHERLINK_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`: HMAC signing secret for access tokens. Required; at least 32 characters.
- `NETHERLINK_AUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL`: default `15m`.
- `NETHERLINK_AUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL`: default `720h`.

## API Foundation

All HTTP responses written by the shared helpers use JSON and preserve `X-Request-Id`.
The current API foundation includes:

- `GET /api/v1` as the versioned API root.
- Structured request logs with method, path, status, response size, duration, request ID, remote address, and user agent.
- Panic recovery mapped to `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- JSON `NOT_FOUND` and `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` fallback responses.
- JSON body decoding helpers with unknown-field rejection and a 1 MiB request body limit.
- Bearer auth middleware validates access token signature, expiry, active PostgreSQL session, active user status, and `tokenVersion`.
- Auth endpoints: `POST /api/v1/auth/register`, `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`, `GET /api/v1/auth/sessions`, `POST /api/v1/auth/sessions/{sessionId}/revoke`, `GET /api/v1/me`, `PATCH /api/v1/me`, `GET /api/v1/me/user-id/check`, `PATCH /api/v1/me/user-id`, `GET /api/v1/me/preferences`, and `PATCH /api/v1/me/preferences`.
- Directory read endpoints: `GET /api/v1/users`, `GET /api/v1/users/{userUuid}`, `GET /api/v1/users/by-id/{userId}`, `POST /api/v1/users/batch`, `GET /api/v1/friends`, `GET /api/v1/friend-groups`, `GET /api/v1/groups`, `GET /api/v1/groups/{groupId}`, and `GET /api/v1/groups/{groupId}/members`.

PostgreSQL:

- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `netherlink`
- User: `netherlink_app`

Redis:

- Host: `localhost`
- Port: `6379`
- Database: `0`
- Password: empty by default for local development

MinIO:

- S3 API: http://localhost:9000
- Console: http://localhost:9001
- Local credentials must be filled in `.env`; `.env.example` is only a committed template.

## Configuration Naming

Project-level configuration uses the `NETHERLINK_` prefix, for example `NETHERLINK_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `NETHERLINK_OBJECT_STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`.
Docker Compose maps those values to the official container variables required by PostgreSQL and MinIO.

## Configuration And Secrets

`.env.example` is not a production environment file. It is a committed template that documents required variable names. Real passwords, token signing secrets, object-storage credentials, and production endpoints belong in `.env`, deployment environment variables, or a secret manager.

The API server intentionally fails during startup when required secret variables are missing or malformed. Non-secret local defaults are kept only for developer ergonomics, such as `localhost` hosts and default ports.

## Storage Boundary

The backend should treat MinIO as an internal S3-compatible provider. Public API responses should expose only stable file IDs, public URLs, or short-lived signed URLs. Bucket names, object keys, internal endpoints, and credentials should stay inside backend configuration and database metadata.

Prepared buckets:

- `netherlink-public`
- `netherlink-protected`
- `netherlink-private`
- `netherlink-tmp`

## Redis Boundary

Redis is an auxiliary runtime dependency. PostgreSQL remains the source of truth for users, preferences, sessions, messages, notifications, file metadata, and durable business state.

Initial intended Redis uses:

- Login/register/IP rate limiting. This is the only current Redis business use.
- Short-lived verification or workflow state.
- WebSocket online presence and later fanout support.
- Optional access-token/session lookup acceleration after PostgreSQL-backed auth is implemented.

Redis keys should be namespaced with `nl:` and should have explicit TTLs unless they represent process-owned online state.

## Repository Boundary

The first PostgreSQL repositories cover:

- `users`: create account records, read by UUID/email/public ID/account, update profile fields, check and update public ID with history, enforce public ID change idempotency, increment token version, and update last-seen time.
- `user_preferences`: ensure defaults, upsert full preferences, read by user UUID, and patch preference fields.
- `user_sessions`: create refresh-token sessions, read active sessions, list user sessions, rotate refresh token hash, revoke sessions, and update session last-seen time.
- `friends`: list current-user friend groups, list active friends with keyword/group filters, and read current-user friendship relation metadata.
- `groups`: list current-user groups with keyword/category filters, read group details only for members, and page group members only when the viewer belongs to the group.

These repositories are persistence primitives only. They do not hash passwords, mint tokens, enforce auth policy, or write HTTP responses.

## Auth Boundary

`internal/auth` owns password hashing, refresh token hashing, access-token signing, refresh token rotation, access-token validation, current-user profile validation, public ID policy, and user session management. PostgreSQL remains authoritative for users and refresh token sessions. Redis keys used by auth are namespaced as `nl:rate:auth:*`, have TTLs, and are only rate-limit counters.

Public IDs must match `[A-Za-z0-9_]{4,32}`. `PATCH /api/v1/me/user-id` requires `clientOperationId`, records successful changes in `user_id_changes`, and enforces a 30-day cooldown after each successful public ID change. Self-service `PATCH /api/v1/me` accepts `status` only as `active`; online presence states belong to the later realtime presence layer, not the account-active status used by token validation.

## Testing

Repository tests live under `tests/` instead of the production `internal/` package directories.
Run all current tests with:

```sh
go test ./...
```

The former `internal/database/postgres_test.go` was a single DSN unit test, not a duplicate or repeated test file. It now lives at `tests/postgres_dsn_test.go` with the rest of the external test suite.

## Next Build Steps

1. Add friend request and friend group write APIs on top of the read-only relationship foundation.
2. Add a MinIO-backed implementation of `ObjectStorageProvider`.
3. Add only the file upload-session API skeleton before implementing full chat, posts, or AI workflows.
4. Add WebSocket auth and chat message persistence after identity and file metadata paths are stable.
